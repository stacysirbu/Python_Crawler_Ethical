My first webcrawler. I made it in a way that it requires manual taking of an domain adress and project name for the crawler to work. 
For example, if you want to do a web crawl, you would need to in the create the name of the project as something like:
create_project_dir('Website') and in the data files you would have to manually input create_data_files('Website', 'https://www.website.com') 
Currently, the number of spider crawlers is set to 8.
